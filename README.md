# Wildfire Detection Coursework Repository

## Overview

This repository contains all source code, documentation, and reporting files for the MSc Data Science project: **Detecting Wildfire using Surveillance Data**. The objective is to explore, design, and evaluate classical machine learning models for early wildfire detection from surveillance imagery, using feature engineering and statistical modeling.

## Dataset

The main wildfire dataset is **not included** in this repository due to its large size (116GB).
- Obtain the dataset from: [Etsin Fairdata - Boreal Forest Fire](https://etsin.fairdata.fi/dataset/1dce1023-493a-4d63-a906-f2a44f831898/data)
- Place the extracted files inside `/data/` at the root of this repository.
- Ensure `/data/` is listed in `.gitignore` to avoid uploading large files.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/DevalJadav/wildfire-detection-coursework.git

2. **Download the full dataset** and copy it into `/data/` as described above.
3. **Start MATLAB** and open scripts in the `/code/` directory.
4. **Follow in-code instructions** to preprocess, extract features, train models, and evaluate results.
5. **Review output** and figures in `/results/`.

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2022a or newer
- Local copy of the dataset

---

## Project Details

- All model code relies on classical machine learning (SVM, KNN, Random Forest, etc.) and custom feature engineering (GLCM, DWT, HoG, PCA).
- Results include robust statistical and visual analysis, in line with assessment requirements.
- Coursework assessments and rubrics are available in `/report/`.

---

## Notes

- This repository does **not** include any data or code reliant on neural networks/deep learning, as required by the assessment.
- Large files are excluded for compliance with GitHub and institutional policies.
- For demonstration, consider including a script and/or sample images for basic checks.
- To add new features, propose a pull request or raise an issue.
